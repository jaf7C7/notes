# How to change firewall settings Red Hat

`firewalld`

Summary:

* A 'zone' is a set of allowed services
* A 'service' is a set of allowed ports and rules
* Make a new 'zone' (can copy the current one) and define your own allowed services
* You can also make your own services (e.g. py-http with port=8080)
* Make sure to do `firewall-cmd --reload` to enable changes
* You can do it either via editing .xml files manually or running commands, they do the same thing
* If you get an error check `/var/log/messages` (grep for the error message)
