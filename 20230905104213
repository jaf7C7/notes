# Turn off `^S` (XON/XOFF) terminal flow control


In PuTTY (best option):

> 1. before creating the session go navigate to Connection->SSH->TTY in the list.
> 2. in the "Mode" dropdown box, select IXON (nb: as of version 0.60, this list is not
>    alphabetically ordered)
> 3. put "0" (zero) as the value of IXON.

```
